    "**IMPORTANT:** For this lab, if you haven't finished your code from last week's lab on Decision trees, you will have the option to use the sklearn implementation for a regression tree. However, this doesn't mean that you should skip the previous lab. This is just so that you don't get behind with the content and you don't spend all your time today working on the previous lab. "
